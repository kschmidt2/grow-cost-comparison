        <div class="narrative-item">
          Between February and April, about 3 in 20 working Americans lost their jobs. The percentage of the prime working-age population, those aged 24-54, who are employed fell 11 percentage points from its highest level in 20 years to under 70%, a level not seen since the 1970s.
        </div>
        <div class="narrative-item">
          For the first time, women are experiencing significantly greater job losses than men during a recession. In September, there were 8% fewer women working than there were in February, compared to 6.2% fewer men. 
        </div>
        <div class="narrative-item">
          This disparity is especially stark for parents who have children at home. Mothers have experienced a greater drop in employment than fathers.
        </div>
        <div class="narrative-item">
          Some of these women are still looking for work, with the female unemployment rate sitting at 8%. But many are not: more than 2.6 million women have left the labor force since February.
